# 🚀 React Practice Journey (Fundamentals to Advanced)

This repository tracks my hands-on React.js learning and practice — from core fundamentals to advanced concepts. Below is a breakdown of everything I’ve practiced so far.

---

## 🔰 Fundamentals
- JSX Syntax and Embedding Expressions
- Functional Components and Props
- Event Handling (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)
- State Management using `useState`
- Conditional Rendering (`if`, `&&`, ternary)
- List Rendering with `.map()`
- Key Prop Usage

---

## 🔁 Hooks Practice
- `useState` – State handling
- `useEffect` – Lifecycle, side effects, API calls
- `useRef` – Referencing DOM nodes, persist values
- `useReducer` – Complex state logic, reducer pattern
- `useContext` – Global state sharing across components
- Custom Hooks – Reusable logic encapsulation

---

## 🧱 Component Patterns
- Component Composition
- Props Drilling vs Context
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled Inputs
- Form Handling with validation
- Lifting State Up

---

## 🌐 API & Data Fetching
- Fetching with `fetch` / `axios`
- useEffect + async functions
- Loading, Error, and Success States
- Working with REST APIs (CRUD)
- Dynamic Rendering with API Data

---

## 🧠 Advanced Concepts
- React Router v6:
  - Nested Routes
  - Dynamic Routes
  - Navigation (useNavigate, Link)
- Lazy Loading and Code Splitting
- Performance Optimization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Error Boundaries
- Portals
- Forward Refs

---

## ⚡ DOM vs Virtual DOM
- Understood how React uses Virtual DOM for faster rendering
- Compared how real DOM vs virtual DOM differ in structure and update behavior
